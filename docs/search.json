As the project focuses on tetrapods, begin by identifying the class of organisms in the source (e.g., Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves, Mammalia). The maximum taxonomicScope is class; the minimum could be any. To determine this, considering the following:\n\nPrimary division: Split by class (Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves, Mammalia) as the default level of taxonomicScope.\nLower-level division: If the source provides distinct assessments within the same class (e.g., separate evaluations for breeding vs. non-breeding birds), you must divide further into order, family, or other relevant groups. However, do not divide into lower taxonomic levels unless the source clearly distinguishes them with separate assessments (e.g., a species has “LC” for a breeding population and “EN” for a non-breeding).\n\nredlistLocation: Each red list must have a unique location. This can be a country, stateProvince, county, locality, or a named custom region.\nredlistDate: Each red list must have a unique date.

Manually separating these can be time-consuming.\nIf the source is easy to extract as a whole but difficult to split by class, you can use our split_script to automatically divide the Excel file into multiple class-specific files.\nHowever, to be able to do this, you must have extracted all the information in the red list first. Once you have done it, see the instruction in the Filling the taxon_assessment table section to use the script to divide the file into classes.\n\n\nReport your progress\nTo help track the scope and complexity of each source and inform extraction planning, after you have identified the number of red lists in the source, indicate your progress by filling in the following column in the table of sources:\n\nnumberOfRedlists: The number of identified redlists in the source | values: 1, 2, 3, 4, …, N.\n\nThis number will also be used to name the red list files (see next step).",

Separating species into classes by hand is a difficult process. If you encounter a source that is simple to extract all at once, but difficult to separate by class, you can extract the data for all species as a single redlist and use our splitting script to split the xlsx file into multiple files.\nInstructions to use the file\n1. Copy the script into your working directory where your xlsx with unsorted taxon_assessment data sheet is located.\n2. The script is designed to work with files based on our data extraction template. Fill out bibliography etc. beforehand.\n3. Follow the instructions in the script. The output will be multiple files named filename_Class.xlsx.\n4. The only sheet modified by the script is taxon_assessment, all else stays the same.\n5.

Even if the source you are extracting (1) provides the mapping between non-IUCN and IUCN statuses as part of the PDF/book, or (2) if the mapping of statuses are already published online. However, if the mapping source has already been created, you should use that one and the respective statusMappingSourceID.\n2.1. To create the mapping source check:\n\nIf the same source provides the translation: you will use this criteria. You will create the Excel and PDF files, but you will cite the source in the statusAssessmentTypeCitation, and use its identifier in the statusAssessmentTypeIdentifier.\nIf there are official mapping sources published by the countries or researchers: you will use this criteria. You will create the Excel and PDF files, but you will cite the official document and use its identifier.\nIf there aren’t any mapping sources available or you have a mix of sources: you will have to create your own criteria. You will create the Excel and PDF files, and you will cite the mapping source you created and use as identifier the URL from our GitHub repository.\n\nSo, for all options you will have to create a separate Excel file with its respective documentation PDF (and statusMappingSourceID), but only in the last case you will use a custom identifier.\nYou can create your own criteria based on some previous mapping source (e.g., Belarus statuses are equivalent to Russian ones), but do not copy mapping sources blindly. In all cases, you can check with Flo how to define the statuses. Always try to come up with something, so that we can finalise together.\n\nInstructions to create the status mapping source\nCreating the mapping source involves preparing two documents:\n\nThe table status_mapping_source_X\n\n\nThis Excel file will store the equivalent values of statusCode for verbatimStatusCode, according to a specific source. You will create it using the mapping_sources_template_excel.\nYou should name the file as follows: &lt;status_mapping_source_X.xlsx&gt;, with X = statusMappingSourceID.\nYou should store the file in the status_mapping_sources folder, and name the folder after the statusMappingSourceID.\n\nWhen you are done with the mapping source (Excel and PDF), contact Flo to store it in RegRed’s GitHub repository. This repository will be archived in the future in Zenodo.\n\nFields to be filled in:\n\nstatusMappingID - fill this with the ID of the status_mapping_source_X (it should be the same in every row).\n\nverbatimStatusCode - fill this with the original status code used in the source.\n\nstatusCode - fill with the mapped IUCN status code.\n\nstatusCategory - fill with the status full definition (e.g., “Vulnerable).\n\nstatusMappingBy - select the value from the list of controlled vocabulary.\n\nstatusMappingRemarks - fill with any specifications about your decisions.\n\n\nThe PDF documentation status_mapping_source_X\n\n\nThis PDF document will have a verbal description and a list of the sources used and decisions made to define equivalent values of statusCode for verbatimStatusCode (e.g., to determine that X1 = CR). You will create it using the mapping_sources_template_pdf.\nYou should name the file as follows: &lt;status_mapping_source_X.pdf&gt;, with X = statusMappingID.\nYou should store the file in the status_mapping_sources folder with the correct statusMappingSourceID.\n\nContent of the document:\n\nAuthor: Modelling of Biodiversity Lab (MOBI Lab), Faculty of Environmental Sciences (FZP CZU), &lt;your name&gt;, and &lt;the names of anyone else who assisted you&gt;.\nPlace and date = (e.g. Prague, 30 November 2025)\nTitle: “Mapping of &lt;place&gt; status codes from &lt;year&gt; to the standard of IUCN (2012) version 3.1 (2nd edn)” (e.g. “Mapping of Belarus status codes from 1993 to the standard of IUCN (2012) version 3.1 (2nd edn)”).\n\nSummary: A brief description that clarifies the title or adds more information and explains whether you are using any bibliographical material to guide your interpretation of the categories. In some cases, two or more geographical regions for which mappings already exist use the same categories with identical descriptions but assign them different numbers or letters.\n\nBibliography: The documents and sources you used to define the criteria.\n\nFinal step:\nWhen you are done with the mapping source (Excel and PDF), contact Flo to store it in RegRed’s GitHub repository.

However, as these were created following a different convention (when the metadata was created), this column may be empty.\nIf there is no fileName, then find the document associated with the source checking the sourceIdentifier. If the sourceIdentifier takes you to a broken URL, then use the sourceTitle to search for the source online. If you still do not find it, check with Ivo and Adam, because if the source is there there there should be a digital object related to it.\nIf you find a new digital file for the source, add it to the folder new_sources using the name of the sourceID.\nIf you find a more complete file for the source (PDF or any digital format) you are extracting, you should replace it in the all_sources_to_extract folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningWhat if I find a new source?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you find a new source that is not in the table of sources, first check with those involved in the metadata creation (Ivo and Adam) to see why it is not in the list (maybe there is a reason why it was skipped).\nIf it needs to be added, fill in the details about the new source in the new_sources file and store any associated files in new_sources folder.\nIf the source should be included in the table of sources, it will need to be added by creating a new line at the end of the file and creating the sourceID as a consecutive number. Ivo or Flo will be in charge of creating it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningHow to know if the source has been extracted by the NRL?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck the NRL data and assess whether the source you have is in the NRL database.\nDouble-check that the source is effectively fully extracted, as sometimes NRL has a source but only a few species (e.g., only Mammals not all tetrapods).\n\nIf the source has already been fully extracted by NRL:\n\nIndicate this in the table of sources by filling in the extractionType = NRL.\n\nThe NRL Data Harmoniser will have to adapt the source to RegRed’s structure. You will be done with the source, and you will start over from step 1.2. Pick a source and report progress.\n\nElse, if the source has not already been fully extracted by NRL:\n\nKeep working on the following steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningWhy use automated methods?\n\n\n\n\n\nAI-based extraction using large language models (LLMs) is useful for sources that are difficult to extract manually, e.g., because the information is provided inside text descriptions (and not tables). However, automated extraction depends on scientific species names and threat information being present on the same page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningWhen should a source be extracted automatically?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the source provides text descriptions and does not contain tables that are easy to copy and paste.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningWhen should a source be extracted manually?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the source contains only a few species (e.g., a reptile red list from a country with ~10 species). If scientific species names and threat status information are not present on the same page of the text (as the LLM will fail to detect this).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningWhat happens if I have multiple classes in one source\n\n\n\n\n\nSome sources might include unsorted tables of species (e.g. Fauna, Vertebrates, Amphibians and Reptiles). Separating species into classes by hand is a difficult process. If you encounter a source that is simple to extract all at once, but difficult to separate by class, you can extract the data for all species as a single redlist and use our splitting script to split the xlsx file into multiple files.\nInstructions to use the file\n1. Copy the script into your working directory where your xlsx with unsorted taxon_assessment data sheet is located.\n2. The script is designed to work with files based on our data extraction template. Fill out bibliography etc. beforehand.\n3. Follow the instructions in the script. The output will be multiple files named filename_Class.xlsx.\n4. The only sheet modified by the script is taxon_assessment, all else stays the same.\n5. Finally, you need to manually fix the taxonomicScope column and filename.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningHow do I fill the sourceIdentifier when there is more than one file or document?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways follow this hierarchy of preferred identifiers: DOI, ISSN/ISBN, URL to the PDF or interactive resource, and then URL to the electronic catalogue entry (e.g., a national library).\nURLs should only be used when the source has neither a DOI nor an ISSN/ISBN. If you use a URL, make sure it resolves correctly.\nFill in the identifier field with a resolvable HTTP URI for DOIs and URLs, and an URN for ISBNs. Recommended hierarchy:\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/&lt;doi&gt;, e.g., https://doi.org/10.2909/9a752c28-cb5f-4ead-9922-2a8173e0306b\nISBN: urn:isbn:&lt;isbn&gt;, e.g., urn:isbn:0-486-27557-4\nISSN: urn:issn:&lt;issn&gt;,e.g., urn:issn:0953-4563\nURL to catalogue: e.g., https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10315\nURL to source: e.g., https://example.org/resource.pdf\n\nIf there are additional ISBN or URLs directly linked to the PDF or interactive resource, please include all of them in the Zotero shared library when adding the bibliographic citation (e.g., under ISBN, URL, or in Extra).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nredlist\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningWhat is a red list for RegRed?\n\n\n\n\n\nA red list is uniquely identified by the combination of:\n\ntaxonomicScope: Each red list must have a unique taxonomic scope. As the project focuses on tetrapods, begin by identifying the class of organisms in the source (e.g., Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves, Mammalia). The maximum taxonomicScope is class; the minimum could be any. To determine this, considering the following:\n\nPrimary division: Split by class (Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves, Mammalia) as the default level of taxonomicScope.\nLower-level division: If the source provides distinct assessments within the same class (e.g., separate evaluations for breeding vs. non-breeding birds), you must divide further into order, family, or other relevant groups. However, do not divide into lower taxonomic levels unless the source clearly distinguishes them with separate assessments (e.g., a species has “LC” for a breeding population and “EN” for a non-breeding).\n\nredlistLocation: Each red list must have a unique location. This can be a country, stateProvince, county, locality, or a named custom region.\nredlistDate: Each red list must have a unique date. We will use the year the assessment was conducted.\n\nIf you are uncertain about how to define the taxonomicScope for a source, consult Flo for guidance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningHow to fill the redlistIdentifier or statusAssessmentTypeIdentifier when there is more than one file or document?\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck the previous question “How do I fill the sourceIdentifier when there is more than one file or document?”. The same applies to these identifiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningHow to deal with statusAssessmentType\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the verbatimStatusCodes for the species in our database will be mapped to the latest version of the IUCN statusCodes, this is: “IUCN. (2012). IUCN Red List categories and criteria, version 3.1 (2nd edn). International Union for Conservation of Nature. https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10315”, and has statusMappingSourceID = 1.\nAll the sources used for mapping statuses will be stored in our status_mapping_sources directory, and will have the corresponding citation generated in Zotero.\nIf the statusAssessmentType = IUCN but it is not the latest version of IUCN, or if the statusAssessmentType = Non-IUCN, you will also have to create the status mapping source (see below Dealing with status mapping source).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningWhere do I find the statusMappingSourceID used?\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find the statusMappingSourceID in the mapping_sources_used file.\n\n\n\n\n\nlocation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningWhat sources does RegRed use for geographic locations?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe geographic_entities of are based in the following databases:\n\ngeoBoundaries: A global database of political administrative boundaries. See https://www.geoboundaries.org/visualize.html.\n\nWDPA: The World Database on Protected Areas, the most comprehensive global database on terrestrial and marine protected areas. See https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/search-areas?geo_type=region.\nGlobal Islands: The Global Island Database is a global shoreline and associated global islands database. See https://doi.org/10.1080/1755876X.2018.1529714.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningWhere do I find the standardised information of geographic locations?\n\n\n\n\n\nRefer always to the website of geographic_entities https://regred-project.github.io/geographic_entities/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningWhat happens if I find an error or if none of these options fits my case\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should send Gabriel an email with the name of the locality and a picture (screenshot) of an accompanying map if available.\n\n\n\n\n\ntaxon_assessment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningHow to deal with red list with multiple taxonomic classes?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a red list that has multiple classes in one (e.g., Fauna, Vertebrates, Amphibians & Reptiles) you can use the split_script to automatically divide the Excel file into multiple class-specific files.",
