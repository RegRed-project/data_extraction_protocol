**Everyone is involved in the extraction**   
The [**RegRed**]{colour="#d14024" bg-colour="#fff"} database has six tables that relate to each other through IDs - they will be filled as follows. 

  - The **data extractors** will extract data manually using the [[data_extraction_template](https://czuvpraze.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/teams/czu-in19b7pkjs2ctzgp-Gainsandlosses/Sdilene%20dokumenty/RegRed/data/regred_data_extraction_template.xlsx?d=w4c80628c98c644729594d006e079afa4&csf=1&web=1&e=P8dExb)]{colour="#fff" bg-colour="#31b0e0"} for the tables `source`, `redlist`, and `location`, and will extract data either manually or automatically, depending on the `extractionType` detected, for the `taxon_assessment` table. They will also have to create a file for mapping `verbatimStatusCode` to a standardised `statusCode`, following the [[mapping_sources_template](https://czuvpraze.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/teams/czu-in19b7pkjs2ctzgp-Gainsandlosses/Sdilene%20dokumenty/RegRed/data/status_mapping_sources/regred_mapping_sources_template.xlsx?d=w5a550bfc041d467e9cf7fd6d8237dcca&csf=1&web=1&e=eMLqUr)]{colour="#fff" bg-colour="#31b0e0"}.   
  - The **spatial data generator** will be in charge of verifying the `location` table, and generating the spatial polygons for all `redlistLocation`s following the [[geographic_entities](https://regred-project.github.io/geographic_entities/)]{colour="#fff" bg-colour="#31b0e0"} standard.   
  - The **taxonomy harmoniser** will be in charge of the `taxonomy` table, and will have to reconcile the scientific names in the extracted data to match a taxonomic backbone.  


### Golden rules when using the data extraction template

  - Do not modify the [[data_extraction_template](https://czuvpraze.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/teams/czu-in19b7pkjs2ctzgp-Gainsandlosses/Sdilene%20dokumenty/RegRed/data/regred_data_extraction_template.xlsx?d=w4c80628c98c644729594d006e079afa4&csf=1&web=1&e=P8dExb)]{colour="#fff" bg-colour="#31b0e0"} **under any circumstances**. If you find an error and changes are needed, report it to [Flo]{colour="#fff" bg-colour="#000"}.  
  - Always refer to this protocol to fill the template. Do not assume any decisions that are not contemplated in this document. If you have doubts about the protocol, contact [Flo]{colour="#fff" bg-colour="#000"}.   
  - Always check the "**Definitions**" tab and do not assume any definitions on your side.   
  - Follow the respective controlled vocabulary. If the value you want to add in a column is not there, you have to report this to [Káča]{colour="#fff" bg-colour="#000"} or [Flo]{colour="#fff" bg-colour="#000"}. If needed, the option will be added to the template.  
  - Do not copy and paste values blindly. Verify always what you are copying. Remove double spaces, and spaces in the end or start of values (e.g., "[ ]{colour="#fff" bg-colour="#f7f414"}Mammals" or "Mammals[ ]{colour="#fff" bg-colour="#f7f414"}").   
  - Do not use the value "`Unknown`" for information that is missing. Instead, just leave the field empty. Use `Unknown` only in those cases that have the value as part of the controlled vocabulary.  
  - Verify all the data you extract. Errors can occur, so a careful review is essential to ensure data integrity.  

## 2.2 Filling the `source` table

::: { .callout-warning collapse="true"}
## What happens if I have multiple classes in one source

Some sources might include unsorted tables of species  (e.g. Fauna, Vertebrates, Amphibians and Reptiles).
Separating species into classes by hand is a difficult process. If you encounter a source that is simple to extract all at once, but difficult to separate by class, you can extract the data for all species as a single `redlist` and use our [[split_script](https://czuvpraze.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/teams/czu-in19b7pkjs2ctzgp-Gainsandlosses/Sdilene%20dokumenty/RegRed/code/Splitter/split_script.R?csf=1&web=1&e=DdwV5p)]{colour="#fff" bg-colour="#31b0e0"} to split the xlsx file into multiple files.

**Instructions to use the file**  
1. Copy the script into your working directory where your xlsx with unsorted `taxon_assessment` data sheet is located.  
2. The script is designed to work with files based on our data extraction template. Fill out all other sheets beforehand.  
3. Follow the instructions in the script. The output will be multiple files named `filename_Class.xlsx`.  
4. The only sheet modified by the script is `taxon_assessment`, all else stays the same.  
5. Finally, you need to manually fix the `taxonomicScope` column and `fileName`

## How do I fill the `sourceIdentifier`?

The identifier is a resolvable HTTP URI for DOIs and URLs, and an URN for ISBNs. 

  -   **DOI**: `https://doi.org/<doi>`, e.g., `https://doi.org/10.2909/9a752c28-cb5f-4ead-9922-2a8173e0306b`
  -   **ISBN**: `urn:isbn:<isbn>`, e.g., `urn:isbn:0-486-27557-4`
  -   **ISSN**: `urn:issn:<issn>`,e.g., `urn:issn:0953-4563`
  -   **URL to catalog**: e.g., `https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10315`
  -   **URL to source**: e.g., `https://example.org/resource.pdf`

::: 

::: { .callout-warning collapse="true"}
## What happens if there are several possibilities for a `sourceIdentifier`?

You may have more than one potential identifier, e.g., a DOI and also an URL.

-   Always follow this hierarchy of preferred identifiers: 

1. **DOI**
2. **ISSN**/**ISBN**
3. **URL** to the electronic catalog entry (e.g., a national library)
4. **URL** to the PDF or interactive resource.

-   URLs **should only be used** when the source has neither a DOI nor an ISSN/ISBN. If you use a URL, make sure it resolves correctly.
-   If there are additional ISBN or URLs directly linked to the PDF or interactive resource, please include all of them in the Zotero shared library when adding the bibliographic citation (e.g., under ISBN, URL, or in Extra).

## 2.3 Filling the `redlist` table

::: { .callout-warning collapse="true"}
## How to fill the `redlistIdentifier` or `statusAssessmentTypeIdentifier` when there is more than one file or document?

Check the previous question "**How do I fill the `sourceIdentifier` when there is more than one file or document?**". The same applies to these identifiers.
:::

::: { .callout-warning collapse="true"}
## How to deal with the fields `statusAssessmentType` and `statusMappingID`

-   The `statusAssessmentType` is the **type of assessment system** used to define the status codes for the taxa in the redlist. Most redlists follow an **IUCN** criteria, however, many countries create their own protocols to assign conservation statuses. This is why we need to translate all statuses to a common standard.

-   The `statusMappingID` is the ID for the `statusMappingSource` that has the mapping (i.e., translation) between statuses. 

All the `verbatimStatusCode`s for the species in our database will be mapped to the latest version of the IUCN regional `statusCodes`. This is "*IUCN. (2012). Guidelines for application of IUCN Red List criteria at regional and national levels: Version 4.0. IUCN. https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10336*", and has `statusMappingSourceID = 1`.  

If the `statusAssessmentType = IUCN` but it is not the standard version, or if the `statusAssessmentType = Non-IUCN`, you will also have to create the status mapping source (see below [2.3.1 Dealing with the status mapping source](step_2.html#dealing-with-the-status-mapping-source)).
:::

**Check the definition, examples and recommendations for each field in the Definitions tab of the template for data extraction**

| `redlistID` | fill this value according to the source's `sourceID` and how many redlist the source has (see `numberOfRedlists` in the table of sources), e.g., if `sourceID` = `2`, and you are filling the information for the first red list in the source, then the `redlistID` should be `2_1` | 
| `redlistTitle` | this field will be generated automatically as "*Redlist of <`taxonomicScope`> of <`redlistLocation`> (<year of (``redlistDate``)>)*". Therefore, these fields must be filled first to build the `redlistTitle` |  
| `redlistIdentifier` | this may be the same value as `sourceIdentifier`, but if the red list has a different identifier, use it. Check that it is correct and add it following the recommendations suggested for other identifiers. |
| `redlistDate` |  this may be the same value as `sourceDate`, but if each red list has a different date, add that value. Use only year here (`YYYY`) |
| `geospatialScope` | select from the list of [controlled vocabulary](/sections/appendices/controlled_vocabulary.html#geospatialscope) |
| `taxonomicScope` | select from the list of [controlled vocabulary](/sections/appendices/controlled_vocabulary.html#taxonomicscope) |
| `isTaxonomicScopeFullyReported` | select from the list of controlled vocabulary. Fill with `Yes` if the number of species reported on the redlist is the same as the number of species in the `taxonomicScope` |
| `redlistLocation` | this must be a unique value, not a list. Check if the location refers to a `country`, `stateProvince`, or `county`, if it is a location smaller than a `county`, if the location is a protected area or if it is an island, and search for the correct name in the table of [[geographic_entities](https://regred-project.github.io/geographic_entities/)]{colour="#fff" bg-colour="#31b0e0"} |
| `statusAssessmentType` | select from the list of [controlled vocabulary](/sections/appendices/controlled_vocabulary.html#statusassessmenttype). If it is `Non-IUCN`, you must create the status mapping source following the template |

| `statusAssessmentTypeIdentifier` | check if the mapping source has an identifier and add the value |
| `statusMappingSourceID` | check if the mapping source has an identifier and add the value |

### 2.3.1 Dealing with the status mapping source

Status mapping sources are one of the key values of RegRed. 

All the `verbatimStatusCode`s for the species in our database will be mapped to the latest version of the IUCN regional `statusCodes`. This is "*IUCN. (2012). Guidelines for application of IUCN Red List criteria at regional and national levels: Version 4.0. IUCN. https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10336*", and has `statusMappingSourceID = 1`.   

**Instructions to select the `statusMappingSourceID`**   

1.   If the assessment was done with the latest version of IUCN, then use `statusMappingSourceID = 1`. 

2.   If not, you will have to create the status mapping source (`statusAssessmentTypeCitation`). **Even if the source you are extracting (1) provides the mapping between non-IUCN and IUCN statuses as part of the PDF/book, or (2) if the mapping of statuses are already published online**. However, if the mapping source has already been created, you should use that one and the respective `statusMappingSourceID`.  

      2.1.    To create the mapping source check:
      
        - If the same source provides the translation: you will use this criteria. **You will create the Excel and PDF files, but you will cite the source in the `statusAssessmentTypeCitation`, and use its identifier in the `statusAssessmentTypeIdentifier`**.   
        
        
        - If there are official mapping sources published by the countries or researchers: you will use this criteria. **You will create the Excel and PDF files, but you will cite the official document and use its identifier**.  
        
        
        - If there aren't any mapping sources available or you have a mix of sources: **you will have to create your own criteria**. **You will create the Excel and PDF files, and you will cite the mapping source you created and use as identifier the URL from our GitHub repository**.   
  
      So, for all options you will have to create a separate Excel file with its respective documentation PDF (and `statusMappingSourceID`), but only in the last case you will use a custom identifier.

      You can create your own criteria based on some previous mapping source (e.g., Belarus statuses are equivalent to Russian ones), but do not copy mapping sources blindly. In all cases, you can check with [Flo]{colour="#fff" bg-colour="#000"} how to define the statuses. Always try to come up with something, so that we can finalise together.

```

**Instructions to create the status mapping source**   
Creating the mapping source involves preparing two documents:

1.    The table **status_mapping_source_X**

-   This Excel file will store the equivalent values of `statusCode` for `verbatimStatusCode`, according to a specific source. You will create it using the [[mapping_sources_template_xlsx](https://czuvpraze.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/teams/czu-in19b7pkjs2ctzgp-Gainsandlosses/Sdilene%20dokumenty/RegRed/data/status_mapping_sources/regred_mapping_sources_template.xlsx?d=w5a550bfc041d467e9cf7fd6d8237dcca&csf=1&web=1&e=eMLqUr)]{colour="#fff" bg-colour="#31b0e0"}.
-   You should name the file as follows: <*status_mapping_source_X.xlsx*>, with *X* = `statusMappingSourceID`.
-   You should store the file in the [[status_mapping_sources](https://czuvpraze.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/teams/czu-in19b7pkjs2ctzgp-Gainsandlosses/Sdilene%20dokumenty/RegRed/data/status_mapping_sources?csf=1&web=1&e=9vcdgX)]{colour="#fff" bg-colour="#3169e0"} folder, and name the folder after the `statusMappingSourceID`.  
-   When you are done with the mapping source (Excel and PDF), contact Flo to store it in [**RegRed**]{colour="#d14024" bg-colour="#fff"}'s GitHub repository. This repository will be archived in the future in Zenodo.  

**Fields to be filled in**: 

  -   `statusMappingID` - fill this with the ID of the **status_mapping_source_X** (it should be the same in every row).    
  -   `verbatimStatusCode` - fill this with the **original** status code used in the source.  
  -   `statusCode` - fill with the mapped IUCN status code.  
  -   `statusCategory` - fill with the status full definition (e.g., "Vulnerable").    
  -   `statusMappingBy` - select the value from the list of controlled vocabulary.    
  -   `statusMappingRemarks` - fill with any specifications about your decisions.  

2.    The PDF documentation **status_mapping_source_X**

-   This PDF document will have a verbal description and a list of the sources used and decisions made to define equivalent values of `statusCode` for `verbatimStatusCode` (e.g., to determine that `X1 = CR`). You will create it using the [[mapping_sources_template_docx](https://czuvpraze.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/czu-in19b7pkjs2ctzgp-Gainsandlosses/Sdilene%20dokumenty/RegRed/data/status_mapping_sources/status_mapping_source_template.docx?d=wb0eed893c5e94b17b0b9932ff61e128a&csf=1&web=1&e=ixPLC6)]{colour="#fff" bg-colour="#31b0e0"}, and then save it as a PDF.
-   You should name the file as follows: <*status_mapping_source_X.pdf*>, with *X* = `statusMappingID.` 
-   You should store the file in the [[status_mapping_sources](https://czuvpraze.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/teams/czu-in19b7pkjs2ctzgp-Gainsandlosses/Sdilene%20dokumenty/RegRed/data/status_mapping_sources?csf=1&web=1&e=9vcdgX)]{colour="#fff" bg-colour="#3169e0"} folder with the correct `statusMappingSourceID`.  

**Content of the document**:

-   **Author**: Modelling of Biodiversity Lab (MOBI Lab), Faculty of Environmental Sciences (FZP CZU), <*your name*>, and <*the names of anyone else who assisted you*>.
-   **Place and date** = (e.g. Prague, 30 November 2025)
-   **Title**: "Mapping of <*place*> status codes from <*year*> to the standard of IUCN (2012) version 3.1 (2nd edn)" (e.g. "Mapping of Belarus status codes from 1993 to the standard of IUCN (2012) version 3.1 (2nd edn)").   
-   **Summary**: A brief description that clarifies the title or adds more information and explains whether you are using any bibliographical material to guide your interpretation of the categories. In some cases, two or more geographical regions for which mappings already exist use the same categories with identical descriptions but assign them different numbers or letters.  
-   **Bibliography**: The documents and sources you used to define the criteria.  

**Final step**:    
When you are done with the mapping source (Excel and PDF), contact [Flo]{colour="#fff" bg-colour="#000"} to store it in [**RegRed**]{colour="#d14024" bg-colour="#fff"}'s GitHub repository. This repository will be archived in the future in Zenodo.

## How to deal with red list with multiple taxonomic classes? 
If you have a red list that has multiple classes in one (e.g., Fauna, Vertebrates, Amphibians & Reptiles) you can use the `split_script` to automatically divide the Excel file into multiple class-specific files. 
:::

**Instructions to use the `split_script`**  
The script is located in our shared OneDrive [code/Splitter/split_script.R](https://czuvpraze.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/teams/czu-in19b7pkjs2ctzgp-Gainsandlosses/Sdilene%20dokumenty/RegRed/code/Splitter/split_script.R?csf=1&web=1&e=DdwV5p).

1.    Copy the script into the working directory where your `.xlsx` file with the unsorted `taxon_assessment` sheet is located.  
2.   The script is designed for files that follow our data extraction template. Make sure **ALL** fields are completed beforehand; this should be the last step.
